Normally, I use these codes.
Most of the codes are collected from my mentors, senior brothers, and friends and I modified them as my own.
Some of the codes are written by me.
It's true that there can be so many mistakes as I am a noob programmer.
So, if you find any mistake you can inform me, I will be grateful. Or you can ignore it.

Whenever I learn something new, I will add them to the library. So, I will update this repo continuously.
